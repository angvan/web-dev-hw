    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold</li>
        <li>1 cup sourdough starter,
          <def title="discard is bit of sourdough starter you dump before feeding it">unfed/discard</def></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425Â°, with a rack in the upper third. Grease a
          baking sheet, or line it with parchment.</li>
        <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Work the butter into
          the flour mixture until the mixture is unevenly crumbly.</li>
        <li>Add the starter, mixing gently until the dough is cohesive.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface or piece of
          parchment, and gently pat it into a 6" round about 1"-thick.</li>
        <li>Use a sharp 2 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>" biscuit cutter to cut four
          rounds, cutting them as close to one another as possible. Gently
          push and pat the scraps together and cut two more biscuits.</li>
        <li>Place the biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about
          2" between them; they'll spread as they bake.</li>
        <li>Bake the biscuits in the upper third of your oven for 20 to 23
          minutes, until they're golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the biscuits from the oven, and serve warm. Or cool completely,
          or wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature for several days.
          Freeze, well-wrapped, for longer storage.</li>
      </ol>
