1. Each page will have two \<head\> elements and two \<body\> elements. One is the opening tag and the second is the closing tag. The \<head\> contains high level information about the site, and always comes first within the root element. It also contains the thoughts of the page, indexing information for search results, and can help dictate how the page will visibly look. The only required element in the \<head\> is the \<title\> element.
The \<body\> element is the container for all the content that is intended to be displayed on the browser's page. The \<body\> is the aspect of the site that visitors see and interact with.
2. Structual markup embeds information about the structure of the document whereas Semantic markup is used to reinforce the semantics or meaning of the information within the document. Structural includes elements such as headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists, which help guide a user visually. Examples of Semantic elements are bold, strong, italics, emphasis, superscript, subscript, quotations, etc.
