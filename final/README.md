# Final Assignment
## Angela Vanderpool

1. Almost everything I learned in this class, including GitHub, version control, and repositories was all new to me. I did not know about any of those things prior to this class. I dabbled in html in a class I took 15 years ago, but I remember very little about all of that and definitely did not remember learning css, if it was even around back then.

2. I vaguely remember the process of adding images to websites, italicizing font, etc. However, adding media and color was all new to me so I learned a lot with this class. Having the textbook and utilizing w3schools.com are a great reference when I forget how to do something, or want to try something new. And the longer I work on a project, the more I am able to employ different elements I have learned, and it begins to feel more intuitive.

3. For this work cycle, I started with the basic idea of what I wanted to create, and it grew from there pretty quickly. I began by pulling code from previous assignments. I thought about the elements I liked from previous assignments, and pieced them together, making adjustments as needed, i.e. color, shape, etc. On the haiku and senryu pages, I wanted each poem structured in a certain way on the page. I tried using a \<pre\> tag, but it just wasn't working the way I envisioned, and it just seemed messy when looking at the code. I thought back to assignment 7 and decided to use a container class with id attributes to structure the page better. It worked perfectly! Overall, I am pleased with the way my website turned out.
