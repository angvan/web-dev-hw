# Assignment 6
## Angela Vanderpool


1. I have come across forms all over the web. They include forms to sign up for accounts such as for Netflix, forms for logging into a bank account, search forms for youtube and Google, website feedback, etc. The purpose is varied, from collecting data to creating log in information.

2. Text input would include typing in your name, address, phone number, birthdate, etc. This may be used to register or log in to an account. Selection input allows the user to select from a handful of predetermined choices, and may be used on a website that is taking a survey. Button input is when you only want one option to be selected and it cannot be deselected. This could be used on a form requesting your gender or age group and when it only wants one button selected.

3. My work cycle included reading and taking notes from Module 6, reviewing and revisiting the HTML&CSS book, and then watching the walkthrough for the assignment. I created the assignment following the walkthrough video and decided to add a submit button as a value (like in the video) rather than inserting an image for the submit button. I liked including a placeholder in the textarea for the comments rather than having text that the user would have to erase. I liked the way the fieldset and legend tags organized the page along with the horizonal rule so I added those into my HTML. Since I did not insert an image for the submit button, I added the logo for the store I selected so I would have something in the images folder.
