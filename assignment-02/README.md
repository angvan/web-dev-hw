# Assignment 2

## Angela Vanderpool

The number one reason that I decided to take this class is because it is required for my degree in Media Arts. However, when I first started college a few decades ago, I took a computer science class that introduced me to html and basic programming. I loved it! I really enjoyed the programming languages and what we were able to create by using them properly. Needless to say, I was pleased to see this web design class on my required class list.

So far in this class, I have learned about markdown which I was unfamiliar with before taking this class. I learned more about the internet than I knew before, specifically the difference between the internet and the web, and how the internet connects clients across the world. Also, I now understand what a README is and how it is used.
