      <h1><strong>Tristan and Isolde</strong></h1>
      <h2>By Robert Wagner</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="background">
      <div class="transbox">
      <p><i>TRISTAN.</i> What hast thou sworn?
        <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA</i> (quickly). Vengeance for Morold!
        <br><br>
<i>TRISTAN</i> (quietly). Mindst thou that?
       <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA</i> (animated). Dare you to flout me?—<br>
Was he not my betrothed,<br>
that noble Irish knight?<br>
For his sword a blessing I sought;<br>
for me only he fought.<br>
When he was murdered<br>
no honor fell.<br>
In that heartfelt misery<br>
my vow was framed;<br>
if no man remained to right it,<br>
I, a maid, must needs requite it.—<br>
Weak and maimed,<br>
when might was mine,<br>
why at thy death did I pause?<br>
Thou shalt know the secret cause.—<br>
Thy hurts I tended<br>
that, when sickness ended,<br>
thou shouldst fall by some man,<br>
as Isolda's revenge should plan.<br>
But now attempt<br>
thy fate to foretell me?<br>
if their friendship all men do sell thee,<br>
what foe can seek to fell thee?
<br><br>
<i>TRISTAN</i> (pale and gloomy, offers her his sword).<br>
If thou so lovedst this lord,<br>
then lift once more my sword,<br>
nor from thy purpose refrain;<br>
let the weapon not fail again.
<br><br>
<i>ISOLDA.</i> Put up thy sword<br>
which once I swung,<br>
when vengeful rancor<br>
my bosom wrung,<br>
when thy masterful eyes<br>
did ask me straight<br>
whether King Mark<br>
might seek me for mate.<br>
The sword harmless descended.—<br>
Drink, let our strife be ended!
       <br><br>
(ISOLDA beckons BRANGÆNA. She trembles and hesitates to obey. ISOLDA commands her with a more imperious gesture. BRANGÆNA sets about preparing the drink.)
      <br><br>
<i>VOICES OF THE CREW</i> (without). <br>
Ho! heave ho! hey!<br>
Reduce the sail!<br>
The foresail in!<br>
Ho! heave ho! hey!
     <br><br>
<i>TRISTAN</i> (starting from his gloomy brooding).<br>
 Where are we?
    <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA.</i> Near to shore.<br>
Tristan, is warfare ended?<br>
Hast not a word to offer?
    <br><br>
<i>TRISTAN</i> (darkly). <br>
Concealment's mistress<br>
makes me silent:<br>
I know what she conceals,<br>
conceal, too, more than she knows.
    <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA.</i> Thy silence nought<br>
but feigning I deem.<br>
Friendship wilt thou still deny?
    <br><br>
(Renewed cries of the Sailors.)
    <br><br>
(At an impatient sign from ISOLDA. BRANGÆNA hands her the filled cup.)
    <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA</i> (advancing with the cup to TRISTAN, who gazes immovably into her eyes).<br>
Thou hear'st the cry?<br>
The shore's in sight:<br>
we must ere long (with slight scorn)<br>
stand by King Mark together.
    <br><br>
<i>SAILORS</i> (without). <br>
Haul the warp!<br>
Anchor down!
    <br><br>
<i>TRISTAN</i> (starting wildly). <br>
Down with the anchor!<br>
Her stern to the stream!<br>
The sails a-weather the mast!<br>
(He takes the cup from ISOLDA.)<br>
I know the Queen<br>
of Ireland well,<br>
unquestioned are<br>
her magic arts:<br>
the balsam cured me<br>
which she brought;<br>
now bid me quaff the cup,<br>
that I may quite recover.<br>
Heed to my all—<br>
atoning oath,<br>
which in return I tender<br>
Tristan's honor—<br>
highest truth!<br>
Tristan's anguish—<br>
brave distress!<br>
Traitor spirit,<br>
dawn-illumined!<br>
Endless trouble's<br>
only truce!<br>
Oblivion's kindly draught,<br>
with rapture thou art quaff'd!<br>
(He lifts the cup and drinks.)
   <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA.</i> Betrayed e'en here?<br>
I must halve it!—<br>
(She wrests the cup from his hand.)<br>
Betrayer, I drink to thee!
   <br><br>
[She drinks, and then throws away the cup. Both, seized with shuddering, gaze with deepest emotion,
but immovable demeanor, into one another's eyes, in which the expression of defiance to death fades
and melts into the glow of passion. Trembling seizes them, they convulsively clutch their hearts and
pass their hands over their brows. Their glances again seek to meet, sink in confusion, and once more turn with growing longing upon one another.]
   <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA</i> (with trembling voice).<br>
 Tristan!
   <br><br>
<i>TRISTAN</i> (overpowered). <br>
Isolda!
   <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA</i> (sinking upon his breast). <br>
Traitor beloved!
   <br><br>
<i>TRISTAN.</i> Woman divine!<br>
(He embraces her with ardor. They remain in a silent embrace.)
   <br><br>
<i>ALL THE MEN</i> (without). <br>
Hail! Hail!<br>
Hail our monarch!<br>
Hail to Mark, the king!
   <br><br>
<i>BRANGÆNA</i> (who, filled with confusion and horror, has leaned over the side with averted face,
now turns to behold the pair locked in their close embrace, and rushes to the front, wringing her hands in despair). <br>
Woe's me! Woe's me!<br>
Endless mis'ry<br>
I have wrought<br>
instead of death!<br>
Dire the deed<br>
of my dull fond heart:<br>
it cries aloud to heav'n!<br>
(They start from their embrace.)
   <br><br>
<i>TRISTAN</i> (bewildered).<br>
 What troubled dream<br>
of Tristan's honor?
   <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA.</i> What troubled dream<br>
Of Isolda's shame?
   <br><br>
<i>TRISTAN.</i> Have I then lost thee?
   <br><br>
<i>ISOLDA.</i> Have I repulsed thee?
   <br><br>
<i>TRISTAN.</i> Fraudulent magic,<br>
framing deceit!
   <br><br>
<i>BOTH.</i> Languishing passion,<br>
longing and growing,<br>
love ever yearning,<br>
loftiest glowing!<br>
Rapture confess'd<br>
rides in each breast!<br>
Isolda! Tristan!<br>
Tristan! Isolda!<br>
World, I can shun thee<br>
my love is won me!<br>
Thou'rt my thought, all above:<br>
highest delight of love!
