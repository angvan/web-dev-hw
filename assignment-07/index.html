    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>Everything that keeps me together is falling apart<br>
      I've got this thing that I consider my only art of fucking people over<br>
      My boss just quit the job says<br />
      He's going out to find blind spots and he'll do it</p>
    <p>The third planet is sure that they're being watched<br>
      By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped<br>
      When you get to the promise land<br>
      You're gonna shake the eye's hand</p>
    <p>(CHORUS)
      Your heart felt good, it was drippin' pitch and made of wood<br>
      And your hands and knees felt cold and wet on the grass beneath<br>
      Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue<br>
      From the cold sunlight that's reflected off the moon<br>
      Baby cum angels fly around you, reminding you<br>
      We used to be three and not just two<br>
      And that's how the world began<br>
      And that's how the world will end</p>
    <p>A third had just been made and we were swimming in the water<br>
      Didn't know then was it a son, was it a daughter<br>
      When it occurred to me that the animals are swimming<br>
      Around in the water, in the oceans, in our bodies<br>
      And another had been found, another ocean on the planet<br>
      Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how</p>
    <p>Well, the universe is shaped exactly like the earth<br>
      If you go straight long enough, you'll end up where you were<br>
      And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth<br>
      If you go straight long enough, you'll end up where you were<br>
      The universe is shaped exactly like the earth</p>
    <p>(Repeat CHORUS)</p>
    <p>Everything that keeps me together is falling apart<br>
      I got this thing that I consider my only art<br>
      Of fucking people over</p>
