# Assignment 4
## Angela Vanderpool


1. On *The Wayback Machine*, I looked up Amazon.com in 2007. The design of the webpage seemed simpler, with links on the right side of the page instead of on top. This was pre-Prime so that option wasn't available. The site was similar in that it still shows shopping categories and options on the homepage with photos of those options.

2. I learned a lot with the GIT Module. Learning how to create entirely on my desktop and then push my changes/creations to github.com was useful. Also, understanding the connection between Atom and GitHub desktop will make doing assignments easier going forward. As long as I don't forget all the steps.
