<h1>William Ernest Henley</h1>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<hr />
<p>William Ernest Henley was born in Gloucester, England, and was educated at
  Crypt Grammar School and the University of St. Andrews. While in grammar
  school, Henley studied with fellow poet T.E. Brown. Henley's father was
  a struggling bookseller who died when Henley was a teenager. Tragedy struck
  Henley at the age of 12 when he was diagnosed with tubercular arthritis and
  had to have one of his legs amputated just below the knee. His other foot was
  saved through a radical surgery. Henley began writing poems while healing in
  the infirmary, which is where he wrote "Invictus". His oeuvre of poetry often
  revolves around themes of inner strength and perserverence. Henley was an editor
  for the <i>Scots Observer</i>, and his friendships included Rudyard Kipling
  and Robert Louis Stevenson, who reportedly based his Long John Silver character
  in <i>Treasure Island</i> in part on Henley.</p>
