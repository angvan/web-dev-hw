1. Universal selectors select every element on a page, element selectors select all elements of a certain type, class selectors select elements that have the same class attribute, and id selectors set rules for certain elements with a specific id tag. These selectors go from a broad designation down to very specific declarations with the id selectors. You would determine which selector to use depending on which elements (all, some, or one) you wanted to style.

2. For my color palette I used the colors red, green, and blue of varying shades in order to match the plaid flannel background I found online. The exact rgb values are Crimson #DC143C, SteelBlue #4682B4, and MediumAquamarine #66CDAA.

3. My workcycle: I watched the walk through and looked at the code and css stylesheet on your example webpage. I liked the design on the example code you provided under Module 9 using color, inner elements, what you called "coding art". I started with the css and html from that example as a template and changed it to create my final webpage. For me, it helps to have some sort of a template to begin with before I can create a finished piece since getting started, or just knowing where to start, is the hardest part for me.
