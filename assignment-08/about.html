      <h3>Why Rattlesnakes?</h3>
      <p>The reason I chose rattlesnakes for my project is because when we moved to Montana three years ago, rattlesnakes wore heavily on my mind.
      My son loves garter snakes and would capture and release them all the time where we had lived in the Pacific NW. Initially when we moved
      to Montana, I did not consider rattlesnakes at all, even though I grew up over the border in SE Idaho. Our first home in Montana was
      close to the river and near some rocky outcroppings; the perfect environment for rattlesnakes. My son continued catching and releasing garter snakes
      until I was enlightened to the danger that was lurking all around us. We are lucky he never saw a live rattlesnake on our rental property (only a few
      dead ones on the long driveway), and never caught a baby rattlesnake by accident. After I realized that rattlesnakes were so close in proximity to our home, and throughout Montana,
      in general, I became very afraid for quite some time. Initially I thought all I had to worry about were grizzly bears here! My overwhelming fear eventually  turned into a healthy caution when
      out in nature. Snakes continue to be of great interest to me and my son, and I thought this instructable would be useful to share.
