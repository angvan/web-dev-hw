      <h1>How To Identify a Venomous Rattlesnake</h1>
    </div>
      <div id="intro" class="container">
        <h3>Snakes</h3>
        <p>If you live in Montana, or any other area that has venomous snakes, it is wise to know how to identify a non-venomous snake from a venomous snake.
        Montana has ten different native snakes, and only one of those is venomous. It is known as the Prairie Rattlesnake. Although it is in your best
        interest to stay away from all snakes in the wild, knowing how to tell the difference between one that can hurt you and one with a mostly benign bite,
        is beneficial since not all snakes are of danger to you. The following provides information on how to identify an adult rattlesnake. Following the adult identification you will find a small
        section about baby rattlesnakes, which may be a little more challenging to identify.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="step1" class="container">
      <img src="./images/step-01.jpg" alt="Snake head shapes for identification" width="300" />
       <h3>Head Shape</h3>
       <p>The first thing to look at when identifying a rattlesnake is the head shape. A non-venomous snake will have a more rounded head, whereas a venomous
       rattlesnake will have a triangular shaped head.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="step2" class="container">
      <img src="./images/step-02.jpg" alt="Snakes eyes for identification" width="300" />
      <h3>Eyes and Pit</h3>
      <p>The next clue for indentification is the shape of the eyes and whether or not there is a "pit" present. You would have to be pretty close to the snake
        to determine this characteristic, but it is worth noting, although not recommended too get to close to a snake you are uncertain about. A "pit" is hole
        half-way between the nose and the eye. Venomous snakes have this "pit" characteristic and have an elliptical pupil much like a cat's eye. A non-venomous
        snake has a round pupil.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="step3" class="container">
      <img src="./images/step-03.jpg" alt="Snake belly scales for identification" width="300" />
      <h3>Belly Scale Patterning</h3>
      <p>The third means of identification has its limits in usefulness since you would need to be holding the snake in order to see the belly scales. Also,
        some snakes may violate this pattern. However, if you found a dead snake and were interested in seeing if the snake followed this rule of identification,
        you would look at the scales underneath the end part of the tale. <strong>Please note: It is not recommended to even pick up a dead rattlesnake.</strong> </p>
    </div>

    <div id="step4" class="container">
      <h3>Color Patterning</h3>
      <p>Color patterning is another method of identification, but is also not always accurate as some snakes share similar patterns between breeds. Most
      Prairie Rattlesnakes have black to dark blotches extending along the back to the tail where they change from blotches to rings. Just like with <thead>
      scales, this characteristic could be missing. The best clues for rattlesnakes will always be the head and eye shapes, and the presence of a "pit".</p>
    </div>

    <div id="step5" class="container">
      <h3>Behavior</h3>
      <p>Of course, we couldn't identify a rattlesnake without mentioning its tell-tale rattle located at the end of its tail. Rattlesnakes will hold their
      tails vertically so that their rattle can be heard. Keep in mind, however, some rattlesnakes lose their rattle, and other non-venomous snakes will shake
      tails from side to side and strike objects to make a rattle sound. Mimicking a rattlesnake is their attempt to frighten off would be predators. </p>

    <div id="babysnakes" class="container">
      <h3>Baby Rattlesnakes</h3>
      <p>Baby rattlesnakes pose their own threat. The head shape and "pit" on the face are also a distinguishing feature in baby rattlesnakes, and they have
        the distinctive patterning that is shown in most adult rattlesnakes. Be aware, baby rattlesnakes <em>do not</em> have rattles, rather they possess a small knob or button
        at the end of their tail. As the baby grows and sheds its skin, it will grow its rattle bit by bit. Although baby rattlesnakes do not have as much
        venom as adults, it is more potent, and baby rattlesnakes cannot control the amount of venom they secrete into their victim making them potentially
        more dangerous than the adult. Adults not only can control the amount of venom secreted, sometimes they don't even secrete any venom when they bite
        unlike the baby who will secrete venom with every bite.</p>

        <h3>First Aid for Venomous Snake Bites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Get away from the snake to avoid additional bites!</strong></li>
          <li>Do not attempt to capture the snake. Even dead snakes can perform "reflex biting" when handled.</li>
          <li>Identify the snake or take a picture if you can do it safely.</li>
          <li>Take off all restrictive items as venom can cause swelling.</li>
          <li>Never cut the would.</li>
          <li>Do not use your mouth to suck out the venom.</li>
          <li>Keep calm as a raised heart rate can cause the venom to travel quicker through your body.</li>
          <li>Obtain assistance as soon as possible.</li>
        </ul>
